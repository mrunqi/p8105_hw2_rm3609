#Set up
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

#Problem 1

Read and clean the data; retain line, station, name, station latitude / longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance. 
Convert the entry variable from character (YES vs NO) to a logical variable (the ifelse or  recode function may be useful).
```{r}
ny_subway = 
  read_csv(file = "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line:entry, vending, ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE))
```
